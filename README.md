# Replication package

**Level Breaks and Finite-Sample GLS Detrending: The Point-Optimal Unit Root
Test and the Purchasing Power Parity Puzzle**

This package reproduces the paper section by section and provides a stand-alone
tool for applying the Model LB test to any user series. All code is Python 3.12,
deterministic given the seeds and replication counts stated below, and built
around a single numerical kernel so that every result — the calibration, the
robustness experiments, the empirical application, and a user's own test — runs
on the identical implementation and the identical long-run-variance convention.

## 1. Layout: one core, one driver per section, one tool

| File | Kind | Reproduces |
|---|---|---|
| `mlb_core.py` | **Kernel library** (not run directly). The single implementation of the Model LB test and its finite-sample calibration: the `@njit` numerical kernels, the calibration driver `run_grid`/`aggregate`, the single-series interface `run_test`, and the validation gates (`python mlb_core.py --selftest`). Everything else imports from here. | — |
| `replicate_section3_4.py` | Driver | **Sections 3–4**: the calibration surface `c-bar(m,T)` with the critical values of the five M-class statistics, and Figure `cbar`. Writes `cbar_surface.csv` (the input to Sections 5 and 6). |
| `replicate_section5.py` | Driver | **Section 5**: robustness (`ar1`, `oracle`, `trimming`) and the power comparison (`power`) — Tables `ar1-sizepower`, `serial`, `trimming`, Table/Figure `power`. |
| `replicate_section6.py` | Driver | **Section 6**: the PPP application — admissibility `sweep`, sieve-AR(p) `boot`, median-unbiased `hl`, and the two `figures`. |
| `run_model_lb.py` | Tool | **Apply the test to your own series** (see §3 below). |

Supporting modules called by the drivers (not run directly): `mlb_kernel.py`
(pure-Python fallback for `mlb_core.py` when numba is unavailable), `robustness.py`
and `size_power_cbar_comparison.py` (Section 5), `ppp_sweep_bis.py`,
`boot_ppp_cbar.py`, `hl_median_unbiased.py`, `figs_ppp.py`
(Section 6), and `pesaran_cd.py` (a stand-alone cross-sectional-dependence
diagnostic: the Pesaran CD test on the Model LB residuals of the PPP panel;
reported in Section 6 but not used for inference). The trend-break comparison curve in Section 5 uses the CKP
response surface, **inlined** in `size_power_cbar_comparison.py`; the package has no
dependency on the companion growth-empirics paper.

### Data and artifact files

| File | Category | Read by | Produced by | Required? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ppp_panel.csv` | input (public data) | Section 6 (`boot`, `hl`, `figures`) | built from BIS + World Bank | **yes** |
| `exog_dates.csv` | input (public data) | Sections 6 (`sweep`, `boot`, `hl`, `figures`) | primary central-bank sources | **yes** |
| `ppp_ar_diagnostic.csv` | input (derived) | Section 6 (`boot`, `hl`) | AR(p) lag selection on the panel (see below) | **yes** for `hl`/`boot` |
| `cbar_surface.csv` | inter-section bridge | Sections 5–6, `mlb_core`, `run_model_lb` | **`replicate_section3_4.py --full`** | yes — regenerate (bundled copy is a 3-cell placeholder) |

Files the pipeline *generates* and that are therefore NOT shipped as inputs
(they are in `.gitignore`): `hl_results.csv` and `hl_results_wild.csv`
(written by `replicate_section6.py hl`, consumed by the `figures` stage).

**Provenance of `ppp_ar_diagnostic.csv`.** For each currency it records the
AR order `p` used under the null, selected by BIC and general-to-specific on the
post-break residual of `q_it` (max lag `k_max = 10`), together with the implied
`alpha` and scalar half-life for the constant-mean and level-break
specifications. It is supplied ready so the `hl`/`boot` stages need not re-run
the selection; it is fully reconstructible from `ppp_panel.csv` and
`exog_dates.csv`.

**Two Monte Carlo / bootstrap notes.** The package runs three distinct
resampling/simulation procedures — parametric Monte Carlo calibration (§3–4),
sieve-AR(p) bootstrap (§6 calibration), and wild bootstrap (§6 half-life). They
complement each other and are never interchangeable; see `MC_vs_BOOTSTRAP.md`
for the exact assumptions, interfaces, and which number each one produces.

## 2. Installation

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Only `numpy` and `numba` are needed for the core; `scipy` for the sweep,
`matplotlib` for the figures, `joblib` for parallel Monte Carlo. No
`pandas`/`openpyxl` — all I/O is via the `csv` standard library.

---

## 3. Apply the test to your own series

`run_model_lb.py` runs Model LB on one CSV series at break dates **you** supply
and justify as **exogenous** — a policy or regime event dated independently of
the data (the known-date regime of Perron, 1989). It is not an endogenous break
search. It uses the same kernel and the same long-run-variance convention
(OLS-detrended, Perron–Qu) that produce the paper's tables, so your numbers are
comparable to the published ones.

```bash
python run_model_lb.py --csv my_series.csv --date-col year --col log_rer \
    --breaks 1985,1998 --sigma2 maic --calib cbar_surface.csv
```

- `--breaks` accepts dates (matched against `--date-col`) or 1-based positions.
- `--sigma2 {const,maic}`: difference-based (baseline) or Ng-Perron MAIC
  (serial-correlation robust; the applied default).
- `--calib` reads `c-bar` and the tabulated MZt critical value by nearest
  `(m,T)`; omit it and `c-bar = -7` while all critical values are simulated on
  the fly in your exact break configuration.
- `--json out.json` writes the full result. Rejection is the LOWER tail.

## 4. Reproduce the paper (ordered pipeline)

Each driver has `--full` (paper numbers) and `--quick` (smoke test). Sections 5
and 6 read the calibration surface from Section 3–4.

```bash
# (1) Sections 3-4 -- calibration surface + Figure `cbar`  [hours at --full]
python replicate_section3_4.py --full --jobs -1
#     writes cbar_surface.csv (consumed by the next two)

# (2) Section 5 -- robustness + power comparison
python replicate_section5.py all --outdir section5_out
#     or individually:
python replicate_section5.py ar1 --recalibrate      # Table `ar1-sizepower`/`ar1-recal`
python replicate_section5.py oracle                 # Table `serial`
python replicate_section5.py trimming               # Table `trimming`
python replicate_section5.py power                  # Table/Figure `power`

# (3) Section 6 -- PPP application
python replicate_section6.py sweep --fetch          # admissibility funnel (see §5 below)
python replicate_section6.py boot                   # sieve-AR(p) calibration
python replicate_section6.py hl                     # half-lives + decomposition
python replicate_section6.py figures                # the two Section-6 figures
#     or the whole application:
python replicate_section6.py all
```

Validation gates (run these first to confirm the build):

```bash
python mlb_core.py --selftest            # size ~ 0.05; |dMZt| ~ 1e-16; power > size
python replicate_section5.py --selftest  # 7 pure-logic gates (no numba needed)
python hl_median_unbiased.py --selftest  # 8 gates (median function, coverage, ...)
python pesaran_cd.py --selftest          # 3 gates (size, common-factor power, design)
```

## 5. Data sources (public)

All data are public and free. The bundled CSVs were built from the sources
below; the sweep stage can rebuild the raw inputs directly.

**BIS — bilateral US-dollar exchange rates (WS_XRU, annual, period average).**
The admissibility sweep downloads the official bulk export with `--fetch`:
`python replicate_section6.py sweep --fetch` retrieves
`https://data.bis.org/static/bulk/WS_XRU_csv_flat.zip` (BIS Data Portal,
Exchange rates dataset) and caches it under `ppp_sweep/cache/`. Homepage:
https://data.bis.org (dataset WS_XRU, "US dollar exchange rates").

**World Bank — Consumer Price Index (FP.CPI.TOTL, 2010 = 100).** Fetched from
the World Bank Indicators API:
`https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL` (JSON), cached
under `ppp_sweep/cache/`. Landing page:
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.

**Construction.** The real exchange rate is
`q_t = ln(CPI_US,t) − ln(CPI_i,t) − ln(XR_i,t)`, with `XR` in local currency per
US dollar. `ppp_panel.csv` is the resulting panel for the eight admissible
currencies over 1973–2024; `exog_dates.csv` lists the exogenous regime-break
dates and their primary sources. Accessed July 2026; the series are periodically
revised at source, so a fresh `--fetch` may differ in the last decimals from the
bundled snapshot without affecting any reject/fail-to-reject verdict.

## 6. Numerical reproducibility

- All Monte Carlo and bootstrap routines use fixed seeds (`config_seed` in
  `mlb_core.py`); results are bit-reproducible on a fixed platform for a given
  replication count.
- Published figures use the full counts (calibration `R` as set inside
  `mlb_core`; bootstrap `B = 9999`; on-the-fly critical values `R = 9999`). The
  `--quick` switches reduce these for testing and are not the published numbers.
- Cross-platform BLAS/threading and numba minor versions can move the last few
  decimals of a simulated critical value; this does not change any verdict at
  the counts above. For exact bit-reproduction, pin `requirements.txt` and run
  single-threaded (`NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=1`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`).

## 7. Method, in one paragraph

Model LB is the no-trend restriction of the CKP (2009) multiple-break setup: a
constant plus known-date level dummies. Under GLS quasi-differencing a level
dummy becomes an impulse, orthogonal across break dates, so the point-optimal
test is asymptotically invariant to the number and location of the breaks and
the optimal detrending parameter keeps the ERS (1996) demeaned value `-7` for
every configuration. In finite samples the optimum departs from `-7` by an
`O((m+1)/T)` remainder, which the calibration prices; the test then delivers the
statistic and its critical value as the coupled output of one calibration. The
application dates the breaks exogenously from currency-regime events and reads
the resulting non-rejections as a correction to the measurement of persistence,
not as a verdict on purchasing power parity.
